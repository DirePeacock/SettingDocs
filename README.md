# Real DM Hours
This is for me to have nice homebrew done easily
it would probably be cool for this thing to have a python script to support a few features
- [] source info from yaml to python
- [] export data from python to MD
- [] have data formatted for use in-game
## generics
[generic format for a homebrew race](generics/race.md)
