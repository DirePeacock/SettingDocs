# Elegapolis
Welcome to the **Free Colony of Elagapolis** founded 10 years ago today, when the  **Draconic Empire** blindsided the **Lachesien Empire** under revolt with timely colonial resources. With their Dying breath the Lachesian Elder Cabal released **The Noblestorm** which has cycled the land to this day. Dissenting pre-colonial leaders have been ostracised from the cities of modern progress with facts and logic.

Today is Genièvre, the 9th of Frimaire, 420th year.

## Peoples of Elegapolis
Any existing lineage **will** be represented here. See **Who's Who** to map lineage to  culture in-universe.

### Orc
Most Likely You’re an **Orc** from a farm somewhere. Genderfluid by natural biology, orcs are characterized by green striped skin. Hardy sociable natives historically held majority here but refrained from the incivilities of imperialism. Orcs from anywhere on/in/around/off the gender spectrum can reproduce with whatever suits them, contributing to their prodigious population.

### Lachesien
You might trace your lineage back to the **Lachesien Empire** who governed until capitulating to the alliance forces and the **Draconian Counsel** a decade ago. Lost from their old ways into reformists & bickering reactionaries.

### Avarician Highlander
Maybe You’re the scion of an **Avarician Highlander** eyrie. Renowned Heroes in their hunting ranges and natural enemies of Flying Dragons and other Avarican Highlanders.

### Animist Tribal Diaspora
You could be one of the **Animist Tribal Diaspora** who coexisted with the orcs before other peoples migrated. Like orcs but with physiological features of various Fauna depending upon their family line and what those ancestors were up to on the 18th Brumaire, 9th Year

### Goblin Islander
You may be a **Goblin Islander** named for the **Greater Goblin Archipelago**. Aloof to imperial aims, the islands house a vibrant society of scholars, engineers, artists & artisans. Here, great dragons were brought low and sent packing, violently ill with tropical disease.

### Chiropterran
Possibly, You're a **Chiropterran** who have just deemed it worth their time to surface for treasures under the sun.

### Heliopolite
Maybe your from a **Heliopolite** colony seeking of wealth and expanding the draconic empire

### Draconian Peerage
You may be born into the privileged **Draconian Peerage**. Followers and descendants of the Divine Counsel, invested with by **First Counsul for Life, Ancalagon the Immortal**. In this World Entities invest worthy individuals with supernatural biology granting them traits that would be reserved to other lineages off-world.

> ##### Not Just Dragons
> other powerful entities can provide this investment. An investiture from anywhere would be universally seen as a sign of station.
